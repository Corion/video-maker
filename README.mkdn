# Video cut

This is the rendering pipeline for recorded videos, as
used for the German Perl Workshop videos.
It produces videos of the same frame rate as the input
videos. You will need to set up the `Makefile` with that frame
rate as automatic extraction is not yet implemented.

## File naming conventions

This setup assumes the following naming convention:

    YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss-talk-title.sequence.MP4
    YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss-talk-title.sequence.mkv
    YYYY-MM-DD-hh-talk-title.sequence.mkv

The date/time is inconsequential, but all videos belonging
to the same presentation need to share the same date/time
value. If you are recording with OBS, this means renaming
all files of the same presentation to the same timestamp.

## Configuration for your event

Create a new config file below `cfg/` , preferrably by copying and editing
an existing config file.

## Preparing the video trimming

The first step is to run

    make -f make/Makefile CONFIG=cfg/gpw2021.cfg prepare-cut

This prepares the metadata files and joins all the partial video files into
large video files.

## Trimming the videos

Trimming the videos at start and end is a process that
requires human supervision. The trim editor is a web application
that runs on the machine where the videos are located.

    CONFIG=cfg/gpw2021.cfg morbo ./video-cutmarks.pl

This launches the editor for editing the video metadata. Go through
all the videos and set the start and end time. Not setting the
start and end time will result in a crash.

Note that currently, Chrome is the best browsers for cutting files as it
supports the `.mkv` format.

The keybindings in the video cutter are:

        // I -> go back to index page
        // F -> save the current state
        // Space -> pause/play
        // Q -> step back a second
        // E -> step forward a second
        // S -> Use as start timestamp
        // shift+S -> play from start timestamp
        // D -> move start timestamp forward 1 second
        // shift+D -> move start timestamp forward 0.1 second
        // A -> move start timestamp backward 1 second
        // shift+A -> move start timestamp backward 0.1 second
        // Y/Z -> Use as stop timestamp, switch to end timestamp
        // shift+Y / shift+Z -> use as stop timestamp, test replay
        if(charCode == 67) { stepff('timer_stop',+1 * (e.shiftKey ? 0.1 : 1 ))};
        if(charCode == 89 || charCode == 90) { stepff('timer_stop',-1 * (e.shiftKey ? 0.1 : 1 ))};

## Setting up the rest of the pipeline

There are other scripts you can use to add a frame around
the video or to paste an image over a part of the video.

For each step, add an appropriate invocation in the `Makefile`
chaining together the `Makefile` prerequisites.

The main advantage of the Perl scripts is that they accept relative
timestamps so you can easily add a frame / fade-in / fade-out
or title card 1 minute before the end of a video.

### Background image / Frame

    video-inset

This script pastes the video over a static background image.

### Overlay

    video-overlay

This script pastes a static image at a fixed position over the video.

### Scaling

    video-scale

This script scales the input video to a given width/height.

## Rendering the videos

    make videos

This (re)generates all videos as necessary.
